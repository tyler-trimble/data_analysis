# Data Analysis

This repository consists of a Jupyter Notebook containing a basic data analysis workflow in Python using libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. It covers importing data, exploring and cleaning the data, visualizing the data, and performing statistical tests.

1. Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

2. Loading Data: It reads data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.

3. Exploring the Data: It displays the first and last few rows of the DataFrame, its shape, information, and descriptive statistics.

4. Sorting the Data: It sorts the DataFrame based on a specific column and displays the highest and lowest scoring players.

5. Cleaning Bad Data Entries: It adds new entries to the DataFrame, handles null values, and filters outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

6. Visualizing Data: It creates a correlation matrix, boxplot, and histograms of the data, and saves the visualizations as images.

7. T-Tests, ANOVA, and Effect Size: It demonstrates hypothetical scenarios for performing t-tests, ANOVA, and calculating effect size between different player positions.

The code provides a comprehensive example of how to perform basic data analysis tasks in Python using pandas and visualize the results using seaborn and matplotlib.
